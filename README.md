<br>
<pre><strong>3/24:</strong> 11866.py used list. wrote better code for printing result + <strong>got better time complexity</strong> However 1158.py seems better. </pre>
<br>
<pre><strong>3/26:</strong> 1271.py Got <strong><u>overflow error</u></strong>. The number n, m had big limits that made overflow.<br>Used '//' to solve it. <strong>// returns integer, not float!</strong>
<br>
      10816.py <strong>TIME ERROR AGAIN‼️</strong> needed to use Dictionary or Counter</pre>
<br>
<pre><strong>3/27:</strong> 1009.py got wrong idea and took forever.</pre>
<br>
<pre><strong>3/28:</strong> 1406.py had problem with time complexity because of list.</pre>
<br>
<pre><strong>3/30:</strong> <del>1075 incorrect. Why..?</del> -> misunderstanding</pre>
